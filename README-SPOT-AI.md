# Spot AI: Skatespot Analyzer

## Overview
The Spot AI tab in the SK8 app allows skaters to analyze skatespots using artificial intelligence. Users can take photos of potential skating locations and receive instant feedback on whether they're skateable, what tricks might work well there, and the overall difficulty level.

## Features

### Current Implementation (Static/Mock)
- **Photo Capture**: Take photos of skatespots or select from your device gallery
- **AI Analysis**: Get mock feedback on:
  - Skateability score (1-10)
  - Spot type detection (street, park, rail, stairs, etc.)
  - Suggested tricks based on the spot type
  - Difficulty rating
- **Save Spots**: Save analyzed spots to your collection
- **Gallery View**: Browse previously analyzed spots

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with real computer vision AI to analyze spot features
- Community sharing of analyzed spots
- Trick tutorial recommendations based on the spot
- Spot rating and commenting system
- Map integration for finding nearby analyzed spots

## Technical Implementation
- Built with React Native and Expo
- Uses camera permissions and ImagePicker for photo capture (requires installation)
- Follows the app's established design system with ThemedView/ThemedText
- Animations for smooth transitions between states
- Mock data to demonstrate functionality

## Installation Requirements
To fully implement this feature, you'll need to install:
```bash
npx expo install expo-image-picker
```
